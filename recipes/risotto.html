        <h2>What is Mushroom Risotto?</h2>
        <p>
            There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, 
            savory flavor to risotto that makes it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. 
            You can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a multi-course Italian menu.

        <h2>Ingredients for Mushroom Risotto</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Chicken brot</strong>
                <p>Homemade chicken broth is always the best choice for flavor, but you can use store-bought chicken broth for convenience. 
                    Choose low-sodium broth and adjust the seasonings at the end. Since you'll keep it hot on the stove 
                    while you're stirring it into the risotto, you can bump up the flavor of the broth by simmering it 
                    ith scraps of shallots, chives, and mushroom stems left over from prepping the risotto ingredients. 
                    To make this vegetarian, substitute vegetable broth. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Olive oil</strong>
                <p>
                    For sautéing the mushrooms and shallots. You won't be cooking at high heat, so it's okay to use extra virgin olive oil. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mushrooms</strong>
                <p>
                    This recipe uses a combination of portobello and white mushrooms. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Shallots</strong>
                <p>
                    If you don't have shallots, you can substitute finely chopped yellow onion. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Arborio rice</strong>
                <p>
                    To get that signature creamy risotto texture, you must use a particular type of short-grain, 
                    high-starch rice like Arborio, Carnaroli, or Vialone Nano that releases its starch as you cook and stir. 
                    No other rice will give you the same results. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>White wine</strong>
                <p>
                    The first liquid you add to the pan after you sauté the rice is a half cup of wine — it will absorb into every grain 
                    and create an essential layer of flavor. Choose wisely. Go for a crisp, dry white wine like pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. 
                    If you don't want to use wine, just start with the broth. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong>
                <p>
                    A generous amount of butter at the end adds more creamy texture and rich flavor.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>
                <p>
                    You've come this far. Don't shortchange the flavor of your risotto by using anything other than freshly grated Parmesan cheese. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Chives</strong>
                <p>
                    Chives cut through the richness and add visual appeal, too. If you don't have chives, fresh parsley is a good substitute. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Make Mushroom Risotto - tips:</h2>
        <p>
            You'll find the measurements and step-by-step recipe directions below, but here are top tips to make the best mushroom risotto: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Hot broth</strong>
                <p>
                    Keep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more into the broth pot than the recipe says to make up for evaporation as it sits. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Toast the rice</strong>
                <p>
                    An essential step to making risotto is to toast the grains in hot oil until they start to turn translucent around the edges. 
                    This could take a couple of minutes. Stir continuously during this process. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stir</strong>
                <p>
                    Yes, you stir risotto as it simmers. That's what helps release the starch from the grains of rice to make that creamy texture you want. 
                    Do you have to stir constantly? No. Stir after each half cup of broth you add to make sure the broth is distributed evenly, 
                    then stir again every 30 seconds or so until almost all the broth is absorbed. Add another half cup of broth and repeat. Listen to music. 
                    Sip some wine. Good risotto is worth the time it takes. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Temperature</strong>
                <p>
                    Keep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Texture</strong>
                <p>
                    Risotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when you bite into it. It should not be as dry as steamed rice, 
                    but should have enough liquid to make it loose. Add just a touch more broth if needed before stirring in the butter and Parmesan cheese. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
            <li>1½ cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
            <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, 
                about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside. </li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated 
                with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. 
                Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, 
                about 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li>
